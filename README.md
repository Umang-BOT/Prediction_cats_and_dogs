# Prediction_cats_and_dogs
In this project i am going to make a ML model which is going to be predict cats and dogs. 
I used CNN architecture where the architecture follws--
-2x(2x[Convolution layer+Activation+BatchNorm]+[maxPool+dropout(for prevent overfiting)])+2x[fully connected layer]+output_layer
Then we will train our model and we will test on 40 images.
